# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Note
1. I have more experience in to JS compared to Typescript, so I have implemented in JavaScript(If required to learn TS, I will learn it quickly)
2. Test cases are not completed as part of this due to time constraint. I will work on it to complete the test case as mentioned
